1. Our goal is to help people with little to no exprience in DeFi gain knowledge and trust in DeFi. So when writing documents ensure the language used is comprehendible to those who have never used DeFi. 

2. Project will consist of 3 independent branches:
	- _main_ branch will have all commits approved by the DeFi Book community. Although this does not mean every project in this branch has been verified, it usually indicates a certain level of trust within the communith. 
	- _develop_ branch can be pulled into from forks. Once PRs are approved by the community - on the basis of document quality in a trustless manner - they'll be available in this branch. A pull request could be created to promot to _main_
	- _features_ branch will include changes made by the core team. These commits are related to DeFi Book features. They'll be pulled into _main_ once tested and production ready. 

3. Analogies are welcome. DeFi is a strange new world to all of us. Akalogies help draw a connection between DeFi and our known world.
